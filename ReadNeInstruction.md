# How to run

    The user lands on the main page, where they can view all the recipes that have been submitted by users and stored in the database. From there the user can click anywhere on the recipe to view more information about it. The user can also use the search bard to search for recipes using a keyword and only the recipes containing that keyword will be displayed. The user can change the websites appearance to darker tones by pressing on the toggle button in the navbar in the top left. To do more, the user must use an account. The user can navigate to the About page with the navbar to learn more about why the app was made. They can register by clicking on the top right of the header and inputing a username and a password which can be used to log in. Once logged in, the user now has the option to add a recipe to their favorites by clicking the button under the recipe cards in the Recipes page. The user can also navigate to the Post Recipe page in the navbar to a form where they can enter the recipes contents. After submitting the form, the recipe will appear in the Recipes page as well as the My Recipes page which is another page the user can navigate to with the nav bar. Here all the recipes submitted by the user will appear.
